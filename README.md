# MyMoneyManagerExReports
A collection of the reports I created in order to expand this amazing accountability tool.

Money Manager Ex [https://www.moneymanagerex.org/] is a free, open-source, cross-platform, easy-to-use personal finance software. It primarily helps organize one's finances and keeps track of where, when and how the money goes. It is also a great tool to get a bird's eye view of your financial worth.

Currently I have the following reports:
* MonthExpensesEvolution. This report gives you in a glance all the expenses of the current month (showing only expenses and withdraws, and excluding the transfers). This report includes the actual expenses and the recurring ones that did not happended yet, but that were scheduled to be payed this month.
