# MyMoneyManagerExReports

A collection of the reports I created in order to expand this amazing accountability tool.

[Money Manager Ex](https://www.moneymanagerex.org/) is a free, open-source, cross-platform, easy-to-use personal finance software. It primarily helps organize one's finances and keeps track of where, when and how the money goes. It is also a great tool to get a bird's eye view of your financial worth.

Currently I have the following reports:

- MonthExpensesEvolution. This report gives you in a glance all the expenses of the current month (showing only expenses and withdrawals, and excluding the transfers). This report includes the actual expenses and the recurring ones that did not happended yet, but that were scheduled to be payed this month. Basically you have in one view where are you in terms of cashflow, and what's ahead (for the current month time-window).
- NextMonthExpenseForecast. This report is quite similar to MonthExpensesEvolution, but gives you a glance of what's ahead in the next month. Quite usefull in the last days of a month, in order to check what you have to deal with in the next 1 or 2 weeks.
- In2MonthsExpenseForecast. Similar to NextMonthExpenseForecast, but in two months time.
- IncomesVsExpensesPercentage. This report compares all your expenses in the las three months, sumarized by category. With each total, it compares with your income total in the same period. This way you can know that categoryXX expenses sums up the YY% of your total incomes.
